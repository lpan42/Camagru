# 1nd web project in 42.
##### This project is about creating an Instegram-like website.
User can use webcam or upload photo, add stickers and post to public gallery. Others can check, like, and comment.
##### P.S. THis is my very own first web project. Very ugly I know.
For this project, I spent a lot of time dealing with canvas, and multiple sticker layers and move and resize the stickers, all with Vanilla Java Script.
